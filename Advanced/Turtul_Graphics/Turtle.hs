------- Comments over the assignments ------

We apologize about some features over this assignments
we know that our implementation cannot cover the function forever
nor than it can allow us to use the parallelization with <|>

Nevertheless, we already thought about how change the source code
to use these features. Currently, we're using a program as a list 
of Action, which disallow us to know which turtle are moving.
We shall change this to another kind of list, or to a list of
operations and parameters, applied to a turtle. By this way,
the implementation of <|> will be just to cross the two lists.

About the forever, the problem is that we have a stack of instructions
instead of a list. By the list implementation of haskell, we're adding
each operations to the stack, then reverse this stack just before 
executing operations. We shall change this by adding all instructions
each time to the end of the list, which will allow the used of the function
forever. In addition to that, the changing of the code for the <|> operation
will also correct another problem of forever : we keep a turtle and an 
instruction in the Action. Such as if we use forever with forward, the
turtle won't go straight away but will spawn to the original point, go to
its direction, then come back to the previous point, then go, etc...
By using Operation and parameters, we will loop over this operation and the
parameters not over the turtles

We also know that the "stepping" function implies to change the implementation
of the type Program. But our aim is now to perform a working program which
will simply works, not something full of error
