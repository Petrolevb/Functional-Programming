-- | An action is either :
--   Move, Turn, Draw, Undraw or Die
data Action = Move | Turn | Draw | Undraw | Die


-- | Move the turtle forward
forward  :: Double -> Program ()
-- | Rotate the turtle to the right
right    :: Double -> Program ()
-- | Move the turtle backward
--   rotating it by 180Â° and then move forward
backward :: Double -> Program ()
-- | Rotate the turtle to the left
--   rotating to the right for 360-'value'
left     :: Double -> Program ()
-- | Change the color of the turtle
color    :: Color -> Program ()
-- | Avoid the turtle to draw for until the pen is down again
penup    :: Program ()
-- | Allow the turtle to draw
pendown  :: Program ()
-- | Kill the turtle
die      :: Program ()  -- We stop the turtle
-- | Set the lifespan of the turtle, it will die when that time reach 0
lifespan :: Int -> Program ()
-- | Repeat a number of time the program
times    :: Int -> Program ()
-- | Run the program forever
forever  :: Program ()

-- a function will "take" the turtle of the program, then apply the action
-- and "build" the new program from it
