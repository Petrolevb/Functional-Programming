-- | Move the turtle forward
forward  :: Double -> Program ()
-- | Rotate the turtle to the right
right    :: Double -> Program ()
-- | Move the turtle backward
--   rotating it by 180Â° and then move forward
backward :: Double -> Program ()
-- | Rotate the turtle to the left
--   rotating to the right for 360-'value'
left     :: Double -> Program ()
-- | Change the color of the turtle
color    :: Color -> Program ()
-- | Avoid the turtle to draw for until the pen is down again
penup    :: Program ()
-- | Allow the turtle to draw
pendown  :: Program ()
-- | Kill the turtle
die      :: Program ()
-- | Set the lifespan of the turtle, it will die when that time reach 0
lifespan :: Int -> Program ()
-- | Repeat a number of time the program
times    :: Int -> (Double -> Program ()) -> Program ()
-- | Run the program forever
forever  :: (Double -> Program ()) -> Program ()
-- | Stops the turtle
